<h1>Superstore - Profitability Analysis(Root Cause)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This Superstore data set was expanded from 51K to 1 million rows. Although sales continued to experience year-over-year growth â€” profitability in certain 
regions continued to decline. In this project, I conducted analysis of each region to identify the root cause of declining profitability in certain areas, and pinpoint which segments are performing the best, and why?
